# Flask

I have added/modified 3 files:

finder.py: Finds Github repositories that can be used for the pre-trained models
Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-Background-Elllimination-and-Convolution-Neural-Network-master/flaskTesting.py: The Flask backend
Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-Background-Elllimination-and-Convolution-Neural-Network-master/ContinuousGesturePredictor.py: I added some code at the very bottom of the file to integrate the model and the Flask backend.

Here is the link to the repository used: https://github.com/SparshaSaha/Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-Background-Elllimination-and-Convolution-Neural-Network
